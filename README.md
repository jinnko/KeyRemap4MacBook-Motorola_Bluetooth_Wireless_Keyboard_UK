KeyRemap4MacBook key remappings for Motorola Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard UK
===========================================================================

This is the private.xml required to get all the keys working correctly on the UK layout Motorola Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard together with a MacBook Pro with UK internal keyboard.

This fixes the following keys: '@~`\#|

Additionally the left search key is mapped to command_l, and the right command is remapped to command_r.

Finally there is a workaround to support remapping the section key to forward delete on the internal keyboard without interfering with the bluetooth keyboard.
